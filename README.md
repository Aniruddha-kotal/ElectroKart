## Overview

ElectroKart is a fully functional Ecommerce Application developed using Java, Spring Boot, and Microservices architecture. It consists of multiple services to handle various aspects of the application, such as order management, payment processing, product catalog, and more.

### Microservices

1. **OrderService:** Manages orders and order-related functionality.
2. **PaymentService:** Handles payment processing and integrates with Spring Security for secure transactions.
3. **ProductService:** Manages the product catalog and related features.
4. **Cloudgateway:** Acts as the gateway for routing requests to the appropriate microservices.
5. **ConfigServer:** Manages configuration properties for the entire application.
6. **ServiceRegistry:** Eureka Server for service discovery within the microservices architecture.

## Features

- **Database:** Utilizes MySQL for data storage.
- **Security:** Implements user authentication and authorization using Spring Security with Okta as the security provider, employing OAuth2 for enhanced security.
- **Circuit Breaker:** Integrates a Circuit Breaker mechanism to limit excessive API requests, ensuring system reliability.
- **Testing:** Conducted extensive unit testing using Junit5 to validate the applicationâ€™s functionality.
- **Containerization:** Docker images created for all microservices, enabling easy deployment and scalability.
- **Orchestration:** Deployed on a Kubernetes Cluster for enhanced productivity and scalability.
